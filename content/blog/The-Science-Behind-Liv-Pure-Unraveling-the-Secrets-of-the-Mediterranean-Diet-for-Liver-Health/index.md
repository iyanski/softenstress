Liv Pure is a dietary supplement that claims to promote liver health through the use of natural ingredients. The supplement is based on the principles of the Mediterranean diet, which is known for its health-promoting properties.

The Mediterranean diet is rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats such as olive oil and nuts. Studies have shown that this type of diet can improve liver health by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress.

Liv Pure contains a proprietary blend of ingredients that are designed to support liver health. These ingredients include milk thistle, which has been shown to protect the liver from toxins, and artichoke extract, which can help to reduce cholesterol levels and improve digestion.

In addition, Liv Pure contains a variety of vitamins and minerals that are important for liver health, including vitamin C, vitamin E, and selenium. These nutrients help to protect the liver from damage and support its natural detoxification processes.

Overall, the science behind Liv Pure is based on the principles of the Mediterranean diet and the use of natural ingredients to support liver health. While more research is needed to fully understand the benefits of this supplement, early studies suggest that it may be a promising tool for improving liver health and preventing liver disease.
